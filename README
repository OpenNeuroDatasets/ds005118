This dataset contains structural (T1w, T2w) and multi-band, multi-echo resting-state fMRI data from a single individual ("ME01", study author CJL). In addition to the raw data, there are several derivatives from a surface-based (fs_LR_32k space) processing pipeline, including individual-specific functional brain networks.   

This data was originally collected as a part of a study exploring the potential benefits of multi-echo fMRI for precision functional mapping (PFM). It is being made publicly available now as an example dataset for implementing PFM routines related to Lynch et al., 2024 XXX; Link TBD). 

The original manuscript (Lynch et al., 2020 Cell Reports; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33357444/) should be cited when publishing work that uses this data.
